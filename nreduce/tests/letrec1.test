This test is to ensure that variable scope is treated properly when constructing
a graph from a series of letrec definitions.

In the code below, the bar function uses the definition f, which is set to
+ x 1. In this case, the x should refer to the x defined in the letrec, i.e. 4.

The bar also contains a reference to x, but in this case it should use the
argument that is supplied to the function, i.e. 2.
