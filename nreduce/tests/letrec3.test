This test is to ensure that variable scope is treated properly when constructing
a graph from a series of letrec definitions.

The letrec in this code defines a variable x of value 4, which is in scope only
for the (* foo 2) expression *and* the bodies of the letrec definitions. The
second usage of x should use the value bound by the lambda expression, which has
the value 11.
