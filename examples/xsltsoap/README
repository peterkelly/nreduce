To run this example:

Run "make" to compile both the servlet and client program. You must have the Axis libraries
in your classpath in order for this to work, since it relies on WSDL2Java.

Copy the whole xsltsoap directory to your tomcat/webapps directory

Start up tomcat

Run the client to test the calculator service (note this assumes the servlet is on localhost):

java client.Client



If you encounter problems:

Specify the URL as an argument to the client (by default it uses localhost):

java client.Client http://full.hostname:8080/xsltsoap/calculator.xsl

If this still doesn't work, there may be errors produced on the server. Since these are not
returned as proper SOAP faults, the best way to find out what has happened is to inspect the
response message from the server. This can be done using Axis's TCPMonitor:

java org.apache.axis.utils.tcpmon
