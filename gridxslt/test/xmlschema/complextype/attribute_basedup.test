Complex type that specifies an attribute that is already declared on the base.
Since we are using extension here, the base version of attribute2 is also
taken into account, and so we should get a duplicate attribute error.

Not 100% sure that this is the correct thing to do... in the XML representation
summary for complex type definition it states we should take the "union" of
clause 1, 2, and 3, which could possibly be interpreted as taking only one of
each attribute declaration. But schema component constraint 3.4.6-1-4 states
that two distinct attribute declarations with the same name and target namespace
are not allowed. According to the latter, it seems we should throw an error
here. Note that this is for the extension case only, not restriction.
