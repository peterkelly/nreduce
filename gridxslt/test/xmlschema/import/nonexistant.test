Not sure if we're really supposed to signal an error here. Witness the following
paragraph in structures 4.2.3:

It is not an error for the application schema reference strategy to fail. It is
an error for it to resolve but the rest of clause 2 above to fail to be
satisfied. Failure to find a referent may well cause less than complete
assessment outcomes, of course.
