XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Formal Semantics - 3.5.4 SequenceType Matching

An "element" SequenceType with only a name is normalized into a nillable
element type with a corresponding name. The reason for the normalization to
allow nillable elements is because the semantics of SequenceTypes in that case
allows it to match every possible element with that names, regardless of its
type or nilled property.
